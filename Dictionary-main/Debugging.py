##Q1. You have been given a dictionary in which you have to print the value of some key. debug the code.
## question1_key2
# details={"name":"Shanti","age":12,"email":"shanti@navgurukul.org",}
# print(details["name"])
# print(details["email"])
# print(details["age"])

##Q2. You have been given a dictionary in which you have to find the sum of all the keys. You have to debug this code and find out how you can get the output as 14.
##question2_key2
# dict1={1:2,2:3,3:4,4:5}
# sum1=0
# sum2=0
# for i in dict1:    
#     sum1=sum1+i
# print(sum1)
# for i in dict1.values():
#     sum2=sum2+i 
# print(sum2)

##Q4.Below is a program in which the keys are between 1 to 15 and the values ​​are the squares of the keys.
##Now you have to fix this program.
##question3_key4
# c=dict()
# for i in range(1,16):
#     c[i]=i*i
# print(c) 



##Q4.You have been given two dictionaries, You need to concatenate them.
# # Now you have to debug the code And your output should be like this :-
# # {'umesh':21,'bijender':54,'amar':67,'peter':89,'sonu':56,'python':20,"gaurav":300,'dev':34,"karan":43}
# # question4_key4
# s={'umesh':21,'bijender':54,'amar':67,'peter':89,'sonu':56}
# a={'python':20,"gaurav":300,'dev':34,"karan":43}
# c={}
# for i in (s,a):
#     c.update(s)
#     c.update(a)
# print(c)
